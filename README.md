# keras-nlp with Tensorflow.js

Javascript implementation of Keras layers for Natural Language Processing.

This is a Typescript library that implements the functionalities of modern natural language processing algorithms with Tensorflow.js. It aims to provide implementation for layers that exists in `tf.keras` and KerasNLP.

Apart from acting as an addon library for Tensorflow.js, this library also enables the porting of a Tensorflow model with KerasNLP layers from Python to Javascript with [tfjs-converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter).

## Installation

This library is published as an npm package. To install with `npm`:
```sh
npm install tfjs-keras-nlp
```
